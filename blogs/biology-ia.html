    <h1>Crafting Your IB Biology IA</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you're currently working on your IB Biology Internal Assessment (IA) and feeling uncertain about the
      requirements, you’re not alone! This guide is designed to help you navigate the essential word count and structure
      of your report, ultimately boosting your chances of success.</p>
    <p>Your Biology IA should be a comprehensive investigation that spans up to <b>3,000</b> words. While there is no
      strict page limit, it's advisable to use a 12-point font with double spacing for clarity and readability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Understanding the Structure of Your IA</h2>
      <p>The basic structure of your IA includes three main sections: the introduction, the main body, and the
        conclusion. Each section plays a critical role in presenting your research effectively.</p>

      <h3>Introduction (Approximately 500 words)</h3>
      <p>Begin your report by clearly stating your research question and providing context for your study. Justify your
        hypothesis based on theoretical knowledge and demonstrate a solid understanding of relevant biological concepts.
        Use specific terminology appropriately and show personal engagement with the topic. It's important to highlight
        your initiative throughout the research process and how it relates to your interests.</p>

      <h3>Main Body (Approximately 2,000 words)</h3>
      <p>This section is where you detail your investigation and analysis. Start with a clear methodology that outlines
        the materials and equipment used in your experiment, followed by step-by-step procedures. Remember to address
        measurement uncertainties and differentiate between controlled and uncontrolled variables, discussing their
        potential impact on your results.</p>
      <p>Once you've outlined your methodology, present your results clearly. Analyze the data trends, investigate
        anomalies, and include relevant quantitative and qualitative data to support your conclusions. Utilize graphs,
        tables, and images for clarity in data presentation.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion (Approximately 500 words)</h3>
      <p>Your conclusion should directly answer the research question while evaluating the investigation's strengths and
        weaknesses. Discuss any environmental concerns related to resource use during your experiment and suggest
        improvements for future investigations. Finally, propose potential areas for further research.</p>
    </section>

        <li>Contents page</li>
        <li>Diagrams</li>
        <li>Labels of five words or fewer</li>
        <li>Headings on diagrams of ten words or fewer</li>

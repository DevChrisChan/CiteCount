    <h1>What is included in the word count of an IB Extended Essay?</h1>
    <p>Are you currently working on your extended essay? It's essential to plan effectively to stay within the word
      limit of <strong>4,000 words</strong>. There is no restriction on the number of pages. Continue reading for
      <strong>CiteCount</strong>'s advice on how to allocate your words to align with the assessment criteria. Our
      extensive experience with IB students can help you achieve top marks in your coursework.
    </p>

    <h2>EE Word Count Guidelines</h2>
    <p>The specific word distribution for extended essays varies by subject due to differing structural requirements.
      However, all EEs share a common framework consisting of an introduction, main body, and conclusion.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Your introduction, which includes background information, should be approximately <strong>600 words</strong>.
      This section should adequately introduce your topic and the objective of your essay, state the research question
      and hypothesis, and outline your research approach. Additionally, you will define key concepts relevant to your
      investigation.</p>

    <h3>Main Body</h3>
    <p>The main body is crucial, as it carries the most weight in terms of assessment points. It should be the longest
      section, ideally around <strong>3,000 words</strong>. The organization of the main body will depend on the subject
      area, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Group 4 subjects</strong> (like Chemistry, Biology, and Physics) will involve variables, equipment,
        results, and their analysis.</li>
      <li>For <strong>History</strong>, these 3,000 words should be split between sources and their analysis.</li>
      <li>The main body of an <strong>Economics</strong> essay will encompass methodology (for both primary and
        secondary data) and analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Allocate the final <strong>400 words</strong> for your conclusion and evaluation. A high-scoring EE includes
      evaluative elements and mini-conclusions throughout the essay. In this section, you will answer the research
      question and summarize the key findings of your investigation. You should also discuss the strengths and
      weaknesses of your work, proposing improvements and extensions.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <h3>Important Reminder!</h3>
      <p>Remember to exclude the following from your word count:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acknowledgments</li>
        <li>Contents page</li>
        <li>Diagrams</li>
        <li>Labels of five words or fewer</li>
        <li>Headings on diagrams of ten words or fewer</li>
        <li>Tables of statistical data</li>
        <li>Equations, formulas, and calculations</li>
        <li>Citations (must be included in the body of the essay)</li>
        <li>References (to be included in footnotes/endnotes)</li>
        <li>Bibliography</li>
        <li>Appendices</li>
      </ul>

            <p class="intro">Academic integrity forms the foundation of the IB program, and understanding how to properly use sources while developing your own ideas is crucial for success. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the sometimes confusing world of citations, references, and academic honesty, ensuring your work reflects both your learning and respect for others' intellectual contributions.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Plagiarism in the IB Context</h2>
            <p>Plagiarism isn't just about copying and pasting from Wikipedia. In the IB program, it encompasses any use of someone else's work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment. This includes text, images, data, ideas, and even structural approaches to arguments.</p>

            <h3>Types of Plagiarism in IB Work:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct plagiarism:</strong> Copying text word-for-word without quotation marks or citation</li>
                <li><strong>Paraphrasing plagiarism:</strong> Rewording someone's ideas without giving credit</li>
                <li><strong>Self-plagiarism:</strong> Reusing your own previous work without disclosure</li>
                <li><strong>Mosaic plagiarism:</strong> Combining phrases from multiple sources without proper citation</li>
                <li><strong>Accidental plagiarism:</strong> Failing to cite sources due to poor note-taking or misunderstanding</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The IB's Approach to Academic Honesty</h2>
            <p>The International Baccalaureate takes academic integrity seriously, and violations can have serious consequences ranging from score reduction to diploma cancellation. However, the IB also recognizes that learning involves building on existing knowledge, and they encourage students to engage critically with sources.</p>

            <h3>IB Academic Honesty Principles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students must acknowledge all sources and references</li>
                <li>Work submitted must be the student's own</li>
                <li>Collaboration must be within specified guidelines</li>
                <li>Students should understand the difference between acceptable assistance and academic misconduct</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When and What to Cite</h2>
            <p>Knowing when to cite sources can be tricky, but here's a practical approach that will keep you on the right side of academic honesty.</p>

            <h3>Always Cite:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct quotes (even single phrases)</li>
                <li>Paraphrased ideas or arguments</li>
                <li>Statistical data or research findings</li>
                <li>Images, graphs, or diagrams not created by you</li>
                <li>Specific theories or models</li>
                <li>Historical facts that aren't common knowledge</li>
                <li>Ideas that influenced your thinking</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>You Don't Need to Cite:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Common knowledge (the Earth orbits the Sun)</li>
                <li>Your own original ideas and analysis</li>
                <li>Widely known historical dates (World War II ended in 1945)</li>
                <li>Common sayings or proverbs</li>
                <li>Your own experiences and observations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When in Doubt:</h3>
            <p>If you're unsure whether something needs citation, err on the side of caution and cite it. Over-citing is much better than under-citing, and it shows academic conscientiousness.</p>

            <h2>Mastering the Art of Paraphrasing</h2>
            <p>Good paraphrasing is one of the most valuable academic skills you can develop. It shows you understand the source material and can integrate it meaningfully into your own work.</p>

            <h3>Effective Paraphrasing Strategies:</h3>

            <h4>1. The Complete Restructure Method</h4>
            <p><strong>Original:</strong> "The rapid urbanization of developing countries has led to unprecedented challenges in infrastructure development, particularly in the areas of water supply and waste management."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Poor paraphrase:</strong> "The quick urbanization of developing nations has caused unprecedented challenges in infrastructure development, especially in water supply and waste management areas."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Good paraphrase:</strong> "As cities in developing nations grow at record speeds, they struggle to build adequate systems for clean water delivery and sewage treatment (Author, 2023)."</p>

            <h4>2. The Concept Translation Method</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the original passage multiple times</li>
                <li>Put it aside and write what you understood in your own words</li>
                <li>Check back to ensure accuracy</li>
                <li>Add proper citation</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. The Question-Answer Approach</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask yourself: "What is the main point here?"</li>
                <li>Answer in your own words</li>
                <li>Ask: "What evidence supports this?"</li>
                <li>Answer with details from the source</li>
                <li>Combine your answers into a coherent paraphrase</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Subject-Specific Citation Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Different IB subjects have varying expectations for source use and citation. Understanding these nuances will help you meet each subject's specific requirements.</p>

            <h3>Group 1: Language and Literature</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Use present tense when discussing literary works</li>
                <li>Integrate quotes smoothly into your analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Group 2: Language Acquisition</h3>

                <li>Cultural context sources must be properly cited</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building a Personal Citation System</h2>
            <p>Developing good habits early will save you time and prevent accidental plagiarism throughout your IB journey.</p>

            <h3>Effective Note-Taking Strategies:</h3>

            <h4>The Three-Column Method:</h4>
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
                <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
                    <th style="padding: 10px; text-align: left; background-color: #f5f5f5;">Source Information</th>
                    <th style="padding: 10px; text-align: left; background-color: #f5f5f5;">Key Ideas/Quotes</th>
                    <th style="padding: 10px; text-align: left; background-color: #f5f5f5;">My Thoughts/Analysis</th>
                </tr>
                <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
                    <td style="padding: 10px;">Smith, J. (2023). "Climate Change Impacts"</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px;">"Rising sea levels threaten coastal cities"</td>
                    <td style="padding: 10px;">This supports my argument about urban planning</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h4>Color-Coding System:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="background-color: yellow;">Yellow highlight:</span> Direct quotes to potentially use</li>
                <li><span style="background-color: lightblue;">Blue highlight:</span> Important concepts to paraphrase</li>
                <li><span style="background-color: lightgreen;">Green highlight:</span> Data or statistics</li>
                <li><span style="background-color: pink;">Pink highlight:</span> My own ideas inspired by the reading</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Digital Organization Tools:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zotero or Mendeley:</strong> Automatic citation generation and PDF organization</li>
                <li><strong>Google Docs comments:</strong> Tag sources directly in your draft</li>
                <li><strong>Notion or Obsidian:</strong> Create interconnected knowledge bases</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional index cards:</strong> Sometimes the old ways work best</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Citation Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

            <h3>Mistake 1: The "Drop Quote"</h3>
            <p><strong>Wrong:</strong> Climate change is a serious issue. "Global temperatures have risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times" (IPCC, 2021). This affects many species.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Right:</strong> Climate change is a serious issue, as evidenced by the IPCC's finding that "global temperatures have risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times" (2021). This temperature increase affects many species...</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Incomplete Paraphrasing</h3>
            <p><strong>Original:</strong> "The educational benefits of technology integration in classrooms are multifaceted and significant."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Wrong:</strong> The educational benefits of integrating technology in classrooms are diverse and important.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Right:</strong> Research shows that incorporating digital tools into teaching provides numerous advantages for student learning (Author, 2023).</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Missing Page Numbers</h3>
            <p>Always include page numbers for direct quotes, and when possible, for paraphrases too. This helps readers find your sources and shows precision in your research.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: Inconsistent Citation Style</h3>
            <p>Pick one citation style (usually MLA for humanities, APA for sciences) and stick with it throughout your entire piece. Mixing styles looks unprofessional and confuses readers.</p>

            <h2>Collaborative Work and Group Projects</h2>
            <p>The IB program includes various collaborative elements, from Group 4 projects to CAS activities. Understanding the boundaries of collaboration is essential.</p>

            <h3>Acceptable Collaboration:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brainstorming ideas together</li>
                <li>Sharing sources and resources</li>
                <li>Peer feedback on drafts</li>
                <li>Discussing concepts and approaches</li>
                <li>Dividing research tasks in group projects</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unacceptable Collaboration:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing sections of individual assignments for others</li>
                <li>Sharing completed work to copy</li>
                <li>Having others edit your work beyond feedback</li>
                <li>Using the same structure or argument as another student</li>
                <li>Submitting group work as individual effort</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Using AI and Technology Ethically</h2>
            <p>As AI tools become more common, understanding their ethical use in academic work is increasingly important.</p>

            <h3>Acceptable AI Use:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Grammar and spell checking</li>
                <li>Brainstorming topics and approaches</li>
                <li>Explaining difficult concepts</li>
                <li>Generating practice questions</li>
                <li>Translation assistance (with disclosure)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unacceptable AI Use:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Generating text to submit as your own work</li>
                <li>Having AI write entire sections or arguments</li>
                <li>Using AI to paraphrase sources without understanding</li>
                <li>Generating fake citations or sources</li>
                <li>Relying on AI for critical analysis that should be your own</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Gray Areas:</h3>
            <p>When in doubt about AI use, always disclose it. A simple note like "This draft was checked for grammar using Grammarly" shows transparency and academic honesty.</p>

            <h2>Creating a Personal Academic Integrity Checklist</h2>
            <p>Before submitting any IB assignment, run through this checklist:</p>

            <h3>Content Review:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>□ All direct quotes are in quotation marks with citations</li>
                <li>□ All paraphrased ideas include citations</li>
                <li>□ My own analysis and ideas are clearly distinguished from sources</li>
                <li>□ I've explained why each source is relevant to my argument</li>
                <li>□ Any collaborative work is properly disclosed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Review:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>□ Citation style is consistent throughout</li>

                <li>□ Images and figures are properly attributed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Check:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>□ The work represents my own thinking and effort</li>
                <li>□ I can explain and defend any argument I've made</li>
                <li>□ I've properly acknowledged all assistance received</li>
                <li>□ The work meets the specific academic honesty requirements for this subject</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dealing with Academic Honesty Violations</h2>
            <p>If you realize you've made an error in citation or academic honesty, the best approach is immediate honesty and correction.</p>

            <h3>If You Notice a Problem Before Submission:</h3>

                <li>Fix the issue immediately</li>
                <li>Double-check your entire document for similar problems</li>
                <li>Consider asking your teacher to review questionable sections</li>
                <li>Use this as a learning opportunity to improve your practices</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If a Problem is Identified After Submission:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be honest and transparent with your teacher</li>
                <li>Explain what happened and how you plan to prevent it</li>
                <li>Accept responsibility and consequences</li>
                <li>Use the experience to strengthen your academic integrity practices</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building Long-Term Academic Integrity Habits</h2>
            <p>Academic integrity isn't just about following rules—it's about developing as an ethical scholar and critical thinker.</p>

            <h3>Strategies for Success:</h3>
            <ul>

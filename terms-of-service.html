    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>CiteCount is a tool designed to help users count words in text while excluding citations, with all processing
            occurring on your device. You may use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with
            these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. International Baccalaureate Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>“International Baccalaureate” and “IB” are registered trademarks owned by the International Baccalaureate
            Organization. CiteCount has been developed independently from and is not endorsed by the International
            Baccalaureate Organization. Any references to IB-related terms are for informational purposes only and do

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Service Provided “As Is”</h2>
        <p>We have made every effort to ensure that CiteCount and its companion tools (including but not limited to
            the citation generator, exam timer, exam countdowns, grade calculator, downloadable applications,
            premium/Pro features, blogs, and related tooling and content) accurately perform their stated functions.
            However, all parts of the Service are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind,
            express or implied, including accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose. We are not liable
            for any errors, inaccuracies, omissions, or unexpected behaviour in any feature, tool, or output provided
            by CiteCount or its companion services. Use of the Service and any related tools is at your own risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>CiteCount and its original content, design, and functionality are the intellectual property of CiteCount,

            or documentation—may be copied, reproduced, distributed, or used for any purpose, commercial or otherwise,
            without our prior written permission. However, CiteCount is open-source, meaning the source code is publicly
            available for users to review for safety and transparency. This open-source access does not grant permission
